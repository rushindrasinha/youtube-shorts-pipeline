## Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Get the pipeline callable from Python code (not just CLI), set up the
development infrastructure.

### Tasks

#### P0-1: Pipeline Adapter Layer
- [ ] Create `pipeline/adapter.py` with `PipelineJob` class (see 05-pipeline-adapter.md)
- [ ] Add `JobConfig` dataclass to `pipeline/config.py`
- [ ] Modify `pipeline/draft.py` — add `config: JobConfig = None` parameter
- [ ] Modify `pipeline/broll.py` — add config injection + parallel generation
- [ ] Modify `pipeline/voiceover.py` — add config injection
- [ ] Modify `pipeline/captions.py` — cache Whisper model at module level
- [ ] Modify `pipeline/upload.py` — add OAuth credential injection
- [ ] Modify `pipeline/state.py` — add `start_stage()` and progress callback
- [ ] Modify `pipeline/music.py` — add config injection
- [ ] Write tests for `PipelineJob` (mock all API calls)
- [ ] Verify existing CLI still works (backward compatibility)
- [ ] Replace `openai-whisper` with `faster-whisper` (CTranslate2, 4x faster, 4x less memory)

**Key principle:** All changes are additive. New `config` parameter defaults to `None`,
preserving existing behavior.

#### P0-2: Monorepo + Project Structure (see [02a-monorepo.md](../saas-plan/02a-monorepo.md))
- [ ] Initialize pnpm + Turborepo at repo root
- [ ] Create `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, root `package.json`, `turbo.json`
- [ ] Create `apps/web/` — scaffold Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- [ ] Create `apps/api/` — FastAPI app with `package.json` shim for Turborepo
- [ ] Create `packages/ui/` — shared UI component library (shadcn components)
- [ ] Create `packages/tsconfig/` — shared TypeScript configs
- [ ] Create `packages/eslint-config/` — shared ESLint configs
- [ ] Create `requirements-saas.txt` with FastAPI, Celery, SQLAlchemy, etc.
- [ ] Create `.env.example` with all environment variables
- [ ] Create `docker/Dockerfile.api` and `docker/Dockerfile.worker`
- [ ] Create `docker/docker-compose.yml` for local dev
- [ ] Verify `pnpm dev` starts web + api in parallel
- [ ] Verify `docker-compose up` starts all services

#### P0-3: Database Setup
- [ ] Create `saas/settings.py` with Pydantic Settings
- [ ] Create all SQLAlchemy models (see 03-database-schema.md):
  - `saas/models/user.py` — User, OAuthConnection, UserAPIKey
  - `saas/models/team.py` — Team, TeamMember, TeamInvite
  - `saas/models/job.py` — Job, JobStage
  - `saas/models/video.py` — Video
  - `saas/models/channel.py` — YouTubeChannel
  - `saas/models/subscription.py` — Plan, Subscription, UsageRecord
  - `saas/models/api_keys.py` — UserProviderKey
- [ ] Set up Alembic, create initial migration
- [ ] Run migration, verify schema in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Seed plans table (Free, Creator, Pro, Agency, Enterprise)

**Deliverable:** Pipeline callable from Python. Docker dev stack running. DB schema
created. Ready for API development.

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| YouTube API quota limits (10K units/day) | Can't upload videos | Apply for higher quota; batch uploads during off-peak |
| ElevenLabs rate limiting | Voiceover failures | BYOK keys; queue-based rate limiting; fallback TTS |
| Gemini API changes/pricing | B-roll generation breaks | Abstract image generation; add DALL-E/Flux fallback |
| Whisper CPU bottleneck | Slow captions | faster-whisper migration; GPU workers; pre-compute |
| Stripe integration complexity | Billing bugs | Extensive webhook testing; use Stripe test mode |
| YouTube TOS violations | Account bans | Content screening; default to private; user acknowledgment |
| API cost spikes | Negative margins | Usage-based billing; hard limits on free tier; BYOK |
| Security breach | User data leak | Encryption at rest; pen testing; audit logs |
